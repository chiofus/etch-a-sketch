This website can be used to create a quick sketch, with functionality to paint in any color the user would like.


This project that taught me about JavaScript integration into a web development project.

It was very rewarding to learn how to dynamically add HTML elements using JavaScript.
I had a lot of fun developing the painting functionailities for the website, and I learned a lot about what standards are used to make sure text remains eligible and readable despite the background color of a website.
I also learned a lot about the different input elements that can be used in a website (color picker, range for selecting the grid size).
